Add-To-Cart -
• User should be able to add products in a Cart. The cart should persist as a MongoDB Session and expire after a week’s time.

• Create routes for the cart where the user can see the cart, and calculate the total sum of cart products and the quantity of each product listed.

• checks if a product is already present.if present then we will only update the count otherwise we will add a new product altogether.

Authorisation
• While signing up the user should be able to choose from either signing up as a Retailer or Consumer.

• Retailers should be the only ones who can add a new product whereas Consumers cannot add and can only buy products.

• Both can add products to the cart.

• Important! Retailers should be able to edit or delete products which are added by them only not any other.
